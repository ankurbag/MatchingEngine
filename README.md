# MatchingEngine
Implemented a Matching engine and an orderbook for a specific product for a stock exchange. 
Also implemented a test class that displays the full functionality of the Matching Engine.

The Matching Engine processes adding and canceling limit orders and executes trade when there is a
cross in the Orderbook.

Instructions
Compiling and running main.cpp would output all the test cases, demonstrating the full functionality
